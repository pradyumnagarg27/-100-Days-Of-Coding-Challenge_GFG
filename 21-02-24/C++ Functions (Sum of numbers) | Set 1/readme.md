# C++ Functions (Sum of numbers) | Set 1
Given three numbers A, B, C you have to write a function named **calcSum()** which takes these 3 numbers as arguments and returns their sum.  
  
**Input:**  
The input line contains T, which denotes the number of testcases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of a single line which contains three space separated integers A, B, and C.  
  
**Output:**  
Corresponding to each testcase, output sum of A, B and C in a new line.  
  
**User Task:**  
Since this is a functional problem you don't have to worry about input, you just have to complete the function calcSum().
