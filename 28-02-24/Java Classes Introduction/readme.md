# Java Classes Introduction
Create class named Cuboid with fields length,width and height. Calculate volume of the cuboid.  
  
Class Cuboid contains following functions:  
**1. set_height(int l):** sets the length of the cuboid.  
**2. set_width(int w):** sets width of the cuboid.  
**3. set_height(int h):** sets height of the cuboid.  
**4.volume():** Prints the volume of the cuboid.  

### Input:
The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. For each test case, three integers are given.

### Output:
For each test case, the output is the volume of the cuboid.

### User Task:
Since this is a functional problem you don't have to worry about input, you just have to complete the functions given set_height(), set_width(), set_height() and volume().
