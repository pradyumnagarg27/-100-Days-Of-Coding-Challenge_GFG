# Print the pattern | Set-1
You are given a number N. You need to print the pattern for the given value of N.  
  
For N = 2 the pattern will be   
2 2 1 1  
2 1  
  
For N = 3 the pattern will be   
3 3 3 2 2 2 1 1 1  
3 3 2 2 1 1  
3 2 1  
  
**Note:** Instead of printing a new line print a "$" without quotes. After printing the total output, end of the line("$") is expected.
