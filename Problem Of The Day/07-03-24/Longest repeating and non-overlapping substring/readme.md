# Longest repeating and non-overlapping substring
Given a string s of length n, find the longest repeating non-overlapping substring in it. In other words find 2 identical substrings of maximum length which do not overlap. Return the longest non-overlapping substring. Return "-1" if no such string exists.  
  
**Note:** Multiple Answers are possible but you have to return the substring whose first occurrence is earlier.  
  
**For Example:** "abhihiab", here both "ab" and "hi" are possible answers. But you will have to return "ab" because it's first occurrence appears before the first occurrence of "hi".
