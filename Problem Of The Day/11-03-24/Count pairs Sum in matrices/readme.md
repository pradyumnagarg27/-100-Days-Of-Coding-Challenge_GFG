# Count pairs Sum in matrices
Given two sorted matrices mat1 and mat2 of size n x n of elements. Each matrix contains numbers arranged in strictly ascending order, with each row sorted from left to right, and the last element of a row being smaller than the first element of the next row. You're given a target value, x, your task is to find and count all pairs {a, b} such that a is from mat1 and b is from mat2 where sum of a and b is equal to x.
